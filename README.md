A new Flutter project.
Its a challenge given by a technical club of my college, they wanted me to built an app using flutter, 
use ai however you wish, they say...

So here i am holding the combined efforts of Claude 3.7 sonnets codes handled and guided by ChatGPT 4.0's guidance
and minor|legitimate debugging by me..||.|.

Things I learned within the 11 hours i spent on it:
Flutter is codebase that works as a universal app builder, Flutter based apps can run on android/ios/web/windows simply every platform.
Apart from being platform-friendly, we can leverage the extensive libraries and quick help from its pre-existing codes.

Every thing in an app is a Widget, yes whether be it the buttons on the screen, the grids we scroll past..........
