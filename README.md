# gallery_app

A new Flutter project.
Its a challenge given by a technical club of my college, they wanted me to built an app using flutter,

So here i am holding the combined efforts of Claude 3.7 sonnets codes handled and guided by ChatGPT 4.0's guidance
and minor|legitimate debugging by me..||.|.
